abstract: Can welfare policies generate welfare chauvinism? I propose that, despite reducing scarcity, welfare expansion can generate welfare chauvinism when the immigrant-native divide is salient because the allocation of resources is framed around inter-group competition. I test this hypothesis in France, and exploit the staggered roll-out of a public housing policy around a population threshold. I show that municipalities with large pre-policy exposure to immigration react to public housing expansion by voting more for the National Front, i.e., the only party with an explicit welfare-chauvinist platform. An analysis of newspaper circulation reveals that, in the same places, local public opinion perceives a nexus between public housing and immigration. Conversely, municipalities with low pre-policy exposure to immigration respond to the policy with lower support for the National Front and a weaker association between public housing and immigration. Overall, the evidence suggests a role for anticipated (but not actual) competition over welfare benefits to be the driving force behind the results, and sheds new light on the challenges of adapting the welfare state to increasingly diverse societies.
