abstract: Can international confrontation create incentives for regime change? If so, under what conditions? And in which direction? I propose a formal model of regime transition where the leader's incentives to regime change depend on threats of international conflict and domestic audience costs. In the first period, the leader decides on whether to change regime. In the second, he or she decides how to act in the international conflict. In the third, the selectorate decides on whether or not to re-select the leader. For each opponent regime type, I obtain probabilities of regime transition that depend on exogenous institutional settings and endogenous probabilities of aggression. I find that threat of conflict always generates a positive probability of further power centralization. However, when an autocratic regime faces a democracy, there is also a window of  opportunity for political liberalization. Across cases, institutional reforms are used to insulate the leader from possible domestic audience costs, or as a commitment to a conflict strategy.
