abstract: Does higher transparency to voters affect rhetorical choices in parliaments? We study the effect of televised broadcasts of floor debates on the rhetorical choices in U.S. Congress, focusing on a measure of emotionality constructed using computational linguistics methods. First, we show in a differences-in-differences analysis that the introduction of C-SPAN broadcasts in 1979 increased emotionality in the House relative to the Senate, which did not introduce televised floor debates until later. Second, we report an instrumental-variables analysis, which shows higher expressed emotionality among Congress Members from House Districts where constituents watch more C-SPAN due to exogenous variation in channel positioning. While C-SPAN affects the use of emotional rhetoric, it has no effect on measures of legislative effort and constituency representation. We highlight that C-SPAN has a distinct effect from newspaper coverage, that achieves the opposite results, and propose that this is due to the unmediated nature of C-SPAN coverage. These findings suggest that C-SPAN has changed the incentives behind rhetorical choices and hint to importance of voters as the new intended audience.
