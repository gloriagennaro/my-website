abstract: This paper proposes a mobilization theory of the adoption of populist strategies and provides evidence from US elections â€“ the presidential elections in 2016 and the 2018 midterm elections. A populist electoral campaign attracts disillusioned voters but may de-mobilize core partisans. A populist strategy is more tempting for outsiders in districts with low trust in traditional politics (also caused by economic insecurity) and where the election is close.

summary: Do candidates use populism to maximize the impact of political campaigns? We show that candidates strategically adapt when campaigning in stiffly competitive districts with high levels of economic insecurity.
