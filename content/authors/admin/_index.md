Welcome! I am a PostDoc at the [Immigration Policy Lab](https://immigrationlab.org), at ETH Zurich.

My research focuses on the political economy of advanced democracies, in Western Europe and in the US. I use cutting-edge causal inference techniques with machine learning and natural language processing to improve our theoretical understanding of democratic politics. My work has been published in The Economic Journal and in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

I received my PhD in Public Policy and Administration at [Bocconi University](https://www.unibocconi.eu/wps/wcm/connect/Bocconi/SitoPubblico_EN/Navigation+Tree/Home/programs/phd/PhD+in+Public+Policy+and+Administration/). During my PhD, I visited [NYU](https://as.nyu.edu/content/nyu-as/as/departments/sociology.html) and [Harvard University](https://economics.harvard.edu).
